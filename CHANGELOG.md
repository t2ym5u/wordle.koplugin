# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Italian. Pick it from the language menu: 1,629 common words can be the
  answer and 9,246 are accepted as guesses, conjugated verb forms included,
  all accent-normalized (PERCHÉ -> PERCHE). Words come from
  napolux/paroleitaliane (MIT); answers were chosen by frequency
  (hermitdave/FrequencyWords). Italian UI and rules translations.
## [1.2.2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- The Tools menu entry is translated again. `main.lua` took `_` from
  KOReader's `gettext`, which knows nothing of this plugin's strings, so the
  menu label stayed English while the game's own screen, which goes through
  `i18n`, was translated. `_` now comes from `i18n` here too.


## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Picks up game-common v1.5.0. Play statistics were recorded under a key no
  tool could match: `ReaderUI`/`FileManager:registerModule()` rewrite a plugin
  instance's `name` to `reader<id>` / `filemanager<id>` right after it is
  built, so this game's sessions were split across two rows and neither
  carried its plugin id. Rows written under the old keys are merged back on
  first read. The same release brings the `stopPlugin()` /
  `deletePluginSettings()` hooks KOReader 2026.07 calls when a plugin is
  deleted from the device (PR #15240).

  No change to this plugin's own code -- it inherits all of it from the
  shared library.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Separate answer and guess lists for English, the way Wordle itself splits
  them: 2,307 common words can be drawn as the answer, while 8,637 are accepted
  as guesses.

### Fixed
- Ordinary English guesses were rejected as "not a word" — STARE, TEARS, IRATE,
  NOTES, QUIRK, FJORD, LYMPH and ADIEU among them. A single 716-word list was
  serving as both the answer pool and the entire notion of "is that a word".
- README advertised word lists for "EN, FR, DE, ES (and more)" and a
  configurable 4/5/6 word length; only EN and FR have ever existed, and nothing
  sets the word length. That path also reached `math.random(0)`, since every
  bundled list is 5-letter only; it is now guarded.
