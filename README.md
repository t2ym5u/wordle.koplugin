## Rules

Guess the secret 5-letter word in 6 attempts. After each guess, tiles reveal: **green** = right letter right spot; **yellow** = right letter wrong spot; **grey** = letter not in word. The keyboard tracks used letters.

## Concept

Guess the hidden 5-letter word in 6 attempts. After each guess, each letter is marked:
- **Correct** — right letter, right position
- **Present** — letter is in the word but in the wrong position
- **Absent** — letter is not in the word

## Features

- **Three languages** — EN, FR and IT
- **Separate answer and guess lists (EN, IT)** — in English 2,307 common words can be the answer, while 8,637 are accepted as guesses, so ordinary English words are never rejected as "not a word"; in Italian 1,629 common words can be the answer and 9,246 are accepted, conjugated verb forms included
- **On-screen keyboard** — shows letter status at a glance
- **Hard mode** — revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses
- **Daily puzzle** — one puzzle per day derived from the date (reproducible seed)
- **Free play** — unlimited random puzzles
- **Statistics** — win streak, guess distribution histogram
- **Auto-save** — resume an in-progress game after closing KOReader

## Why e-ink friendly?

Each guess is a discrete, low-frequency interaction. The letter-status feedback
uses distinct fill patterns (solid / hatched / empty) instead of colours alone,
so the puzzle remains readable on greyscale e-ink screens.
